Hello, I am a graduate student in the Biogeochemical of Global Contaminants group in the department of Environmental Science and Engineering at Harvard University. I am broadly interested in understanding how contaminants cycle in the environment and impact wildlife and human health. Currently, I apply isotope measurements to understanding the sources and cycling of mercury in the environment and foodwebs.
